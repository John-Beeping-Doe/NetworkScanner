# Network Scanner - Architecture & UI Design

## Version 1: Core Features

- **Integrated Tools (v1):**
  - Ping
  - Traceroute
  - DNS Lookup
  - Port Scan
  - Subnet Sweep
  - ARP Scan

- **Typical User Flow:**
  1. Select tool from sidebar.
  2. Input target IP or domain.
  3. Start scan.
  4. View results (live as they stream in).

- **Simultaneous Scans:**  
  - The application must support running many tools and scans in parallel.
  - Scans and queries should be able to run simultaneously (not queued unless technically required).

- **Results & Data Display:**
  - All standard outputs for each tool (see tool specs).
  - Color-coding and clear, modern layout are priorities.
  - Live, real-time updates as results are received.
  - Ability to save, filter, and export results for any scan.

- **Navigation & Layout:**
  - **Side panel** for selecting tools.
  - **Split-screen main workspace**: tool input/config on left, results on right.
  - **Live updates** in results panel.
  - Color coding is key for clarity (success, warnings, errors, open/closed ports, etc.).
  - Dark/light mode: use whatever is easiest or default (no strong preference).

- **User Preferences & Config:**  
  - None for v1 (minimal config).

- **Target Platform:**  
  - Cross-platform native app (Windows, Mac, Linux) using Dioxus Desktop.
  - No web version (native only).

## Version 2: Planned Enhancements

  - Real-time output/log export.
  - Scan scheduling.
  - System notifications.
  - Device fingerprinting.
  - Persistent scan history.

## Design Notes

- **User Experience:**  
  - Fast, clean, easy to useâ€”no unnecessary steps.
  - Everything should be color-coded and visually clear.
  - Focus on running multiple scans/queries at once with no conflicts.
  - Responsive layout with split panels for maximum information density.

- **Tech Stack:**  
  - [x] Rust for all logic, networking, and UI via Dioxus Desktop.
